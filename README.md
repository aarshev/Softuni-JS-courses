# Softuni-JS-courses
In this repo I am posting all the homework, tasks and exercises I do for the JS path in the Softuni academy .

All the codes for JS Basics and JS Fundamentals are not properly sorted. All the tasks for every single theme are in one js file for the concrete theme.

Going forward to JS Advanced, the task will be sorted properly, each task in a seperate file, which will be in folder for the current theme.
